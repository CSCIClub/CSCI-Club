   <p>According to the 2015 Department of Campus Involvement study, 71% of St. Cloud State students report being involved on campus. 
 National research shows that students who are involved in activities outside of class have better grades, feel more connected to
 their university/college, and graduate in less time than students who are not involved. At St. Cloud State University we have over 
200 student organization with more than 1,300 leadership positions. The opportunities are endless and the skills you learn can be 
 applied long after you graduate.Below are a few different ways the Department of Campus Involvement is here to help you in your 
 Husky experience. Visit the HuskiesConnect Directory to see a list of all the current registered student organizations on campus.
 If you arenâ€™t sure where to begin in your involvement journey meet with a Husky Involvement Guide and they will provide personalized 
  suggestions of different opportunities just for you.We hope you join us for our annual campus traditions, Mainstreet and Sidestreet. 
  These two campus events are a great way to connect with different student organizations, departments and services on campus to see 
  all the wonderful opportunities waiting for you.</p>
