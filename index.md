## Welcome

Welcome to the official Github account for Computer Science Club. First we will like to Thank you for giving your interest
for our project.

# Who are we?

Computer Science Club is one of the club in Saint Cloud State University where we work with students to be a better programmer. We always meet on Monday from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm and we do a lot of fun stuffs related to Github. Currently , Computer Science Club has started an Open Source Project where interested students from University can contribute to the project.
Before we begin to do actual project, we will do some Mark down and learn to use Git and Github.

## About Project

Open-Source project using [Angular](https://angular.io/start) in the Front-end and [ASP.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-3.0) in the back-end along with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as our goto editor.

As mentioned earlier, we want you all to get used to Git/GitHub, which is the major source control used by most of the companies these days, so take some to go over these introductory videos on [GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE) and using [Git with VS Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOwyH2-VCVY).
